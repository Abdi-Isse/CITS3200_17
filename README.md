### Project: A new web-based galaxy classification tool using deep learning

#### Project Goal
The goal of this project is to develop a web-based platform, where users can input a galaxy image, then the AI (i.e., python code using Keras/tensorflow) in the platform will automatically classify the image into a morphological category (e.g., spiral or elliptical galaxy) and show the result online.

The platform will require a connection to a server where the classification task by the AI can be done very quickly.

We also require the input/output image transfer between the server and the web to be done quickly. 

Many images of galaxies can be found [here](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html)
